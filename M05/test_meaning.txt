Testing the python files gives a pass or fail result given certain testing parameters.
It shows the results of all the tests whether they passed or failed.
The FAIL entry will give details about the failure:
    -The name of the method
    -The naime of the module
    -A traceback to the line that failed
    -Details of that error / expected result / actual result
using '-v' can give extra information regarding unit testing in a given program.
